        Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites and
        web applications. It encompasses both the front-end (user interface) and
        back-end (server-side) development. Front-end web development focuses on
        designing and building the visible parts of a website, including layout,
        content, and user interactivity, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Back-end web development involves server-side programming
        and database management, ensuring the functionality and data storage
        necessary for web applications to work smoothly. Web developers often
        use various frameworks, libraries, and tools to streamline development
        processes, enhance website performance, and create dynamic and
        responsive web experiences.
